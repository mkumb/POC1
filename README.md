POC1 AWS Repository
In this I will be adding some significant parts of AWS I have touched upon
Hyperlink to try out git
creating a repository
creating objects in the repository including systems ones like readme.md, etc.
instead of making changes directly 
were create a branch of the repository
make the changes in the branch.
commit them
then raise a pull request
get the pull request reviewed. By using GitHubâ€™s @mention system in your pull request message
after successful review 
merge pull request
branch changes have been merged - so can delete the branch.
